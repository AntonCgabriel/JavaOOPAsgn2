We have mostly done all coding together either physically or over discord with screens shared. We have thereby been able to quickly reach out to each other when struggling and then solved the code together. Once someone was done with a task he would just go over the next available task. 
Therefore many of the User Stories were made of all three group members.
However, below follows some of the tasks contributed by each member of the group.
